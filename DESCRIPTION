Description: Collection of functions for fitting and interpreting distributed lag interaction models with index modification (DLIM-IM). A DLIM-IM regresses a scalar outcome on repeated measures of exposure and allows for modification by an index constructed from multiple candidate modifiers. Includes a MCMC_sampler_m() function for sampling from the posterior, pred_m() function for inference, and plotting functions for visualization.
